# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: HTML work on Memory Spaces Website

**Thoughts:** I like using templates and changing the code. I also need to start from scratch. I will edit the template we have on FH live websites which needs updates. Then I will spend a little time working on Memory Spaces HTML for later use when a domain and hosting become available. I may just use Github Pages. The markdown for Memory Spaces can also be mirrored to the blog. Not sure if that will be necessary, the blog may be worthless. Need to fix width of LinkedIn post, doesn't look good on mobile. Could use some graphics.

### Day 1: October 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5

**Thoughts** I've got my hands full. Much of my hour is getting set up, and then focusing on coding. I am still trying to resolve an issue with FH Website. I think I can fix it, but just trying to read it and solve it is not successful. I think I can find the answer tomorrow, I just want to make sure I don't waste time at the end of the night searching for something that may end up turning into hours and making me lose sleep. I am counting this log as part of my hour. It is markdown so I think it counts. I like VS Code and it is beginning to make more sense. I will work on both sites tomorrow. Today was a bit of a struggle bus with my Thesis and the Writing Manuscript for GAP. I have a lot of work to do, so I may end up coding first to get it out of the way and to ensure that my time management for my coursework is still good. I did go through some tutorials, which apparently don't count. I would like to dispute that because freecodecamp to me is coding. That is my personal opinion and I think it is in the intent. It is active programming as opposed to video tutorials where you sit and watch someone else code. Anyway, plan for tomorrow: some more freecodecamp, Memory Spaces website with the pitch script in markdown, and FH Website LinkedIn embed fix for mobile.  


### Day 2: October 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML and Memory Spaces

**Thoughts** I did a little more freecodecamp to warm up and gain some insights and skills. Then I took what I learned and started working on Memory Spaces.
