# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: HTML work on Memory Spaces Website

**Thoughts:** I like using templates and changing the code. I also need to start from scratch. I will edit the template we have on FH live websites which needs updates. Then I will spend a little time working on Memory Spaces HTML for later use when a domain and hosting become available. I may just use Github Pages. The markdown for Memory Spaces can also be mirrored to the blog. Not sure if that will be necessary, the blog may be worthless. Need to fix width of LinkedIn post, doesn't look good on mobile. Could use some graphics.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
