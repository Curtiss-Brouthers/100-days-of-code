# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: HTML work on Memory Spaces Website

**Thoughts:** I like using templates and changing the code. I also need to start from scratch. I will edit the template we have on FH live websites which needs updates. Then I will spend a little time working on Memory Spaces HTML for later use when a domain and hosting become available. I may just use Github Pages. The markdown for Memory Spaces can also be mirrored to the blog. Not sure if that will be necessary, the blog may be worthless. Need to fix width of LinkedIn post, doesn't look good on mobile. Could use some graphics.

### Day 1: October 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Basic HTML and HTML5

**Thoughts** I've got my hands full. Much of my hour is getting set up, and then focusing on coding. I am still trying to resolve an issue with FH Website. I think I can fix it, but just trying to read it and solve it is not successful. I think I can find the answer tomorrow, I just want to make sure I don't waste time at the end of the night searching for something that may end up turning into hours and making me lose sleep. I am counting this log as part of my hour. It is markdown so I think it counts. I like VS Code and it is beginning to make more sense. I will work on both sites tomorrow. Today was a bit of a struggle bus with my Thesis and the Writing Manuscript for GAP. I have a lot of work to do, so I may end up coding first to get it out of the way and to ensure that my time management for my coursework is still good. I did go through some tutorials, which apparently don't count. I would like to dispute that because freecodecamp to me is coding. That is my personal opinion and I think it is in the intent. It is active programming as opposed to video tutorials where you sit and watch someone else code. Anyway, plan for tomorrow: some more freecodecamp, Memory Spaces website with the pitch script in markdown, and FH Website LinkedIn embed fix for mobile.  


### Day 2: October 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Basic HTML and Memory Spaces. The outline of headings and subheadings is good. Need CSS for the lists.

**Thoughts** I did a little more freecodecamp to warm up and gain some insights and skills. Then I took what I learned and started working on Memory Spaces.

### Day 3: October 18, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Published Memory Spaces on Netlify. It is live and connected to Github. 

**Thoughts** I had a lot of coursework and a lot writing. I did get to enjoy some webinars/workshops through MLH. The best was Adobe XD. I am so impressed by how easy they make the creation of mockups and prototypes for websites and apps. I really want to use it and try it out. I am sure that in a hackathon it will display very well, but for Memory Spaces too I think I can come up with something. Maybe that is something I can do tomorrow, on top of reading for LSE 540 and writing 321 Reflect. I have had a couple gaps in my 100 Days of Code, but I plan to continue to dedicate time to this. HTML and CSS especially. I don't know which I like more, hackathons or... I don't know. I love the short and sweet rounds of competitive problem-solving. I have to balance that with coursework. Every minute spent working on one project is two minutes away from another. It adds up. Not to mention that I am a husband and father. These are good times for us. Building this skill allows me to be around more and also helps me with my ability to teach them something I am confident will help them in the future. With Rob, I have think of a way to get him to think like a scientist and engineer. He could excel. With the kids, I am trying to get them to play with their toys in creative and curious ways. They are doing great. For Melissa, she has her own ways of doing things and I will continue to support her. Her way is the only way to reach her and stay connected. For myself, I want to try Pomodoros, but with the kids a Pomodoro is out the window every 5 minutes. I have to be able to act within a Pomodoro and return to it or abandon it entirely and start a new one. I have to find a balance between time-based blocks and task-based blocks. The hard part for me, is I really like to get into flow and go! This 100 Days of Code is turning into a journal and not a lot of code haha. Maybe I make an app for that. Time blocks and Task blocks. Off the top of my head, 20 minutes for movement, 20 minutes for reading, and 20 minutes for doing. If either bleeds or creeps, continue, but as soon as a lull, interruption, or distraction occurs, immediately go into the next cycle. Depending on the progress, if the balance is off, return attention at the next possible cycle to the area which needs the focus. I am thinking again about the Adobe XD and how I could make a mockup for every project I have. Could I do a mockup in 20 minutes? If so, I could have three done in three hours, 6 done in 6 hours, and 8 in 8 hours. I need to list my projects, at least the active ones and start designing. Futures Ed and Memory Spaces seem like the priorities right now. 

### Day 4: October 19, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More HTML from FreeCodeCamp.org. Attempted HackerRank 30 Days of Code Day 0 and FAILED! Better luck tomorrow

**Thoughts** I feel like I am working overtime with all the projects but, as we are learning in the LEarning Sciences, I am trying to make connections and high level abstractions while doing and practicing what I am learning. I am writing a lot of HTML and very little CSS. I am looking forward to CSS and JavaScript, but markup or markdown is an important foundation that I need. I also want to make  sure that I am getting the idea of tags and shortcuts down. Getting the use of languages should carry over to what I think will be my main languages, JavaScript and Python.
